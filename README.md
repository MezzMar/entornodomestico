## [entornodomestico](https://mezzmar.github.io/entornodomestico/)'s Webpage.

It uses the usual html and css and a bit of bootstrap. I took the freedom to implement react into this project.

The artist's data is randomly generated from another site and I got the images from the [unsplash API](https://source.unsplash.com/). 

I'm currently working on adding the modals to set the albums' downloads up.
